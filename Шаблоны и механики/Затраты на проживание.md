### Еда
Чтобы отделить еду от других расходов, я беру уровень богатства выше скромного (т. е. Комфортный, Богатый и Аристократический) и даю каждому бонус к хит-дайсу в следующем приключении на три дня, так что употребление «комфортной» еды дает +1 к каждому хит-дайсу во время короткого отдыха, «богатой» - плюс два, а «аристократической» - +3. Этот эффект действует только в том случае, если персонаж питался на этом уровне более четырех дней за последнюю неделю. Его действие прекращается через три дня после последнего приема пищи на этом уровне. Еда, приготовленная в походе или во время приключений, может достигнуть качества «комфорт» только в том случае, если персонаж не обладает соответствующими навыками.

### Жилье и аренда
**Убогий** (тратит 0 золота в день):
*«Вы живете в бесчеловечных условиях. Не имея места, которое можно было бы назвать домом, вы укрываетесь везде, где только можно: пробираетесь в сараи, ютитесь в старых ящиках и полагаетесь на благосклонность людей, которые живут лучше вас. Убогий образ жизни таит в себе множество опасностей. Насилие, болезни и голод преследуют вас повсюду. Другие жалкие люди жаждут ваших доспехов, оружия и снаряжения для приключений, которые по их меркам представляют собой целое состояние. Большинство людей не замечают вас».*

Squallid (Spending 5 cp/day):

“You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town.

You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune.

You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections.

Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback.

They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.”

Poor (Spending 1 sp/day):

“A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community.

Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience.

Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern.

You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease.

People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.”

Aristocratic (Spending at least 5 gp/day):

“You live a life of plenty and comfort.

You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community.

You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn.

You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need.

You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility.

You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery.

The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.”

| 1-2       | Even the best medical care and most pristine of conditions cannot completely protect you from every disease. You have fallen ill.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 3-8       | Your lifestyle of luxury has not gone unnoticed. Although most others look at you in amazement, some gaze with envious eyes. As you walk about the streets one day, you find yourself surrounded by several armed men.                                                               |

Notes:
- For characters living in the wilderness, change hostile thugs to wild animals, encounters with nobles to fey or spirits, etc., and so on. 
- I do life expenses on a once per week or sometimes even a once per day basis. I don’t know whether changing the frequency of rolls will affect anything, but you do you.
- I use [Goblinist RPG Tools](http://tools.goblinist.com/5enc) for encounter generation and [donjon](http://donjon.bin.sh/5e/random/#type=treasure;cr=0;loot_type=Individual%20Treasure) for treasure generation.
- I purposely did not define what types of hostiles the players might encounter. I believe this should be a medium level-appropriate encounter. Remember: The players might be separated at this time and they may or may not be wearing armor. 
- Monetary rewards and punishments are based primarily on the investment in lifestyle the player is making. Change this to level-based if you wish.
- Police encounters may be time consuming. If you are not playing a sandbox adventure, you may wish to eliminate this section.
- Under mundane events, don’t think that you have to read a flavor text for every role. Sometimes nothing exciting happens at all.
- I left types of illnesses blank. Typically, I impose disadvantage on all checks and attacks, disallow regaining hit points, and cut the amount of work a player can do per day in-half.
- I did not create most of the mundane events located at the end of the document. I simply compiled my favorite ones.
- Anything can be a plot hook if your players are paranoid enough.
