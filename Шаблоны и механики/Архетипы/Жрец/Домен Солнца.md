The Gods have long made their presence known in the world, but none have such pronounced power as the Sun Gods. The Domain of the Sun teaches of faith, strength of spirit and the brightness of each individual. For many, the Sun is a symbol of hope and confidence in a bright tomorrow. For others it is the brightness of emotions that carry us from day to day. Clerics of the Sun believe in all the forces and thoughts that carries their luminary, and not infrequently directly draw his strength. It is not uncommon for their personalities to be fiery, and their emotions and feelings to be overflowing. When it comes to battle, the clerics of the Sun are leaders and guides through the weight of battle.

#### Luminary Connection
*1-level Sun domain feature*

The clerics of the Sun domain draw their power directly from this majestic star, so are dependent on the position of the sun relative to the cleric. 

**Day Sun.** During the day, all the cleric's powers and skills behave as normal and work to their full potential.

**Dusk Sun.** As dusk helps others to gain hope, Sun Cleric can use dusk power in the same way. During this time, if cleric uses Ray of Daybreak as Dusk Ray, it doesn't consume a charge.

**Dawn Sun.** As dawn takes people's hope in a better outcome, Sun Cleric can use dawn power in the same way. During this time, if cleric uses Ray of Daybreak as Dawn Ray, it doesn't consume a charge. 

**Night Sun.** After the last ray passes over the horizon, the cleric's connection to the Sun is weakened without direct contact. Range of all skills and cleric spells decreased by 20 feet. But Cleric gains +5 to Intimidation checks.

**Zenith sun.** Solar energy peaks at noon when the Sun is vertically above the cleric. At this point, the cleric enters an Overexcited state for 10 minutes gaining +2 for all ability checks and saving throws and all cleric's radiant damage is increased by 1d8. 

**Solar Eclipse.** As much as the Sun may seem to be overlapped with the Moon during this event, its power only increases due to its direct connection to the Moon. During this event (standardly every 11-18 months), clerics of the Sun domain reach peak power for 1d10 minutes: all ability checks and saving throws done with a quadruple advantage (four dice), all cleric's radiant damage is quadrupled, the divine channels Sunstrike and Solar Flare can be used as a bonus action and do not consume Channel Divinity charges, the number of Sunstrike targets increases to four, Post-Burns stack up to 6 times, and the Radiance feature also deals 10d10 fire damage.  


#### Ray of Daybreak
*1-level Sun domain feature*

The cleric's spirit and the warmth of the Sun can cheer up anyone around him. A cleric of the Sun domain can send a pleasant beam of light that will strengthen an ally's spirit and body or will weaken enemies.

**Dusk Ray.** If an ally within 30 feet must makes a Strength, Constitution, or Wisdom saving throw, the cleric can use a reaction to give that ally advantage on that saving throw. 

**Dawn Ray.** If an enemy within 30 feet must make a Strength, Constitution, or Wisdom saving throw, the cleric can use a reaction to give that enemy disadvantage on that saving throw.

This ability can be used a number of times equal to the cleric's Charisma modifier. The ability restores all charges during a long rest.
